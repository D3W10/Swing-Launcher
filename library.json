            "changelog": "## 0.4.0\n### Added Features\n\n**AI Vs Gregory**\n- We have made big changes to AI Vs Gregory to make it a more interactive experience instead of 3 animatronics chasing you there is only 1 and this dude will RUN he is also not in the SB base game but from another fnaf game;\n- On top of this we have given all animatronics in AI vs Gregory glowing eyes, and implemented mechanics to improve users interactivity with said mode.\n\n**Base Game**\n- As all of you are probably aware we have added Vanny in the character selection menu she can run she can't jump and we gave her a ability.\n\t- If you press Q while playing as Vanny and your near a Gregory a decoy will spawn right in front of where that Gregory is looking. It's meant to be used as a distraction technique so lemme know how it plays out.\n\n**Lobby Changes**\n- We have added montys ball cannons into the lobby there are 2 of them on either side of the main entrance and they get destroyed when the match starts.\n\t- Left click to shoot;\n\t- Right click to zoom in.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Fixed Gregory not getting destroyed after being jump scared;\n- Fixed a issue where when first loading into a game the quality settings would default to Nintendo switch quality;\n- Overall performance improvements.",
